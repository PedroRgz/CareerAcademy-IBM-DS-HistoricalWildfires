# Australian Wildfire Analysis and Visualization

## Part 1: Exploring the Data (GitHub Repository)

The initial stage, hosted on this GitHub repository, focuses on data exploration and visualization. Key highlights include:

* **Data Preparation:** Cleansing and processing wildfire data to ensure its accuracy and suitability for analysis.
* **Visual Insights:** Creating compelling visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to reveal patterns and trends in the data, such as fire frequency, intensity, and affected regions.
* **Interactive Mapping:** Leveraging Folium to generate interactive maps pinpointing wildfire locations and enabling exploration based on geographic factors.

## Part 2: Interactive Dashboard ([Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/@pedro_rodriguez/Australia-Wildfire-Dashboard-e052cfca-9cd3-478c-bebf-7c8271b8e5ba))

While this repository houses the initial analysis, the second part resides within the Deepnote platform in app format. There, you'll find:

* **Interactive Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard developed using Deepnote's capabilities. This dashboard offers:
* **User-friendly Interface:** Explore data interactively through filters, sliders, and other controls.
* **Advanced Visualizations:** Utilize powerful visualization libraries for insightful and engaging representations of the data.

## Why is this important?

* **Stand out in the job market:** Data visualization is highly sought-after in data science. Showcase your skills to impress potential employers.
* **Boost project impact:** Make your data findings more impactful and understandable for diverse audiences through compelling visualizations.
* **Gain deeper data understanding:** Visualizing data helps you uncover hidden patterns and trends, leading to a richer understanding of the information.
* **Become a better collaborator:** Bridge the gap between data and insights, enabling effective collaboration with non-technical colleagues.
